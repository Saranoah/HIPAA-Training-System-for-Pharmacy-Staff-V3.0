## ü§ù Code of Conduct

### Our Pledge

We are committed to providing a welcoming and inclusive experience for everyone. We expect all contributors to:

- Use welcoming and inclusive language
- Be respectful of differing viewpoints
- Accept constructive criticism gracefully
- Focus on what's best for the community
- Show empathy towards others

### HIPAA-Focused Conduct

As a project handling sensitive compliance training, all contributors must also:

- **Protect Sensitive Information:** Never post real patient data, internal configuration details, or any other sensitive information in issues, pull requests, or discussions.
- **Report Violations:** Confidentially report any concerns about unethical conduct or potential privacy/security violations to the project maintainers.
- **Exercise Professional Judgment:** Understand that actions within the project can have real-world implications for healthcare organizations and patient privacy.
  

## üöÄ Getting Started

### 1. Fork and Clone

```bash
# Fork the repository on GitHub
# Then clone your fork
git clone https://github.com/Saranoah/HIPAA-Training-System-for-Pharmacy-Staff-V2.0.git
cd HIPAA-Training-System-for-Pharmacy-Staff-V2.0
```

### 2. Set Up Development Environment

```bash
# Create virtual environment (optional but recommended)
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

# Verify Python version
python --version  # Should be 3.8+

# Run tests to ensure everything works
python test_hipaa_training_v2.py
```

### 3. Create a Branch

```bash
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
# or
git checkout -b fix/issue-number-description
```

## üíª Development Process

### Branch Naming Conventions

- **Features**: `feature/add-new-lesson-module`
- **Bug fixes**: `fix/correct-score-calculation`
- **Documentation**: `docs/update-testing-guide`
- **Refactoring**: `refactor/improve-error-handling`
- **Tests**: `test/add-edge-case-coverage`

### Commit Message Format

Follow the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) specification:

```
type(scope): Brief description

Detailed explanation if necessary

Fixes #issue_number
```

**Types**:
- `feat`: New feature
- `fix`: Bug fix
- `docs`: Documentation changes
- `test`: Test additions or changes
- `refactor`: Code refactoring
- `style`: Formatting changes
- `perf`: Performance improvements
- `chore`: Maintenance tasks

**Examples**:
```
feat(quiz): Add 5 new pharmacy scenarios

Added scenarios covering:
- Medication disposal
- Patient counseling
- Insurance verification
- Prescription transfers
- Adverse event reporting

Fixes #42
```

```
fix(checklist): Correct percentage calculation for empty responses

Previously returned NaN, now correctly returns 0.0

Fixes #38
```

## üìù Coding Standards

### Python Style Guide (PEP 8)

```python
# ‚úÖ Good
def calculate_score(responses: Dict[str, bool]) -> float:
    """Calculate percentage score from responses."""
    completed = sum(responses.values())
    total = len(responses)
    return (completed / total) * 100 if total > 0 else 0.0

# ‚ùå Bad
def calc(r):
    c=sum(r.values())
    return (c/len(r))*100
```

## üîí HIPAA & Security Guidelines

### Handling Protected Health Information (PHI)
- **No Real PHI in Development or Testing:** Never use real patient data for testing, debugging, or in sample files:cite[9]. Generate realistic but completely fictional mock data.
- **Secure Data Practices:** Be mindful of how data is handled, stored, and logged. Avoid printing sensitive information to consoles or logs, even during development.
- **Reporting Security Concerns:** All contributors are obligated to report any potential security flaws or privacy concerns immediately by emailing [your designated security contact]. Do not publicly disclose the issue on GitHub issues:cite[7].

### Security-First Development
- **Risk Assessment:** Consider the privacy and security implications of any new feature or code change.
- **Dependency Management:** Regularly update dependencies to patch known vulnerabilities. PRs that address security vulnerabilities in dependencies are highly prioritized.


### Type Hints Required

All functions must include type hints:

```python
from typing import Dict, List, Optional, Any

def process_data(
    items: List[str],
    options: Dict[str, Any],
    timeout: Optional[int] = None
) -> bool:
    """Process data with given options."""
    pass
```

### Documentation Standards

Every function needs a clear docstring:

```python
def calculate_quiz_score(correct_answers: int, total_questions: int) -> float:
    """
    Calculate quiz score percentage.
    
    Calculates the percentage of correct answers out of total questions,
    with protection against division by zero.
    
    Args:
        correct_answers: Number of questions answered correctly
        total_questions: Total number of questions in the quiz
    
    Returns:
        Percentage score as a float (0.0 to 100.0)
    
    Example:
        >>> calculate_quiz_score(3, 5)
        60.0
        >>> calculate_quiz_score(0, 0)
        0.0
    """
    return (correct_answers / total_questions) * 100 if total_questions > 0 else 0.0
```

### Code Organization

```python
# 1. Standard library imports
import json
from datetime import datetime
from typing import Dict, List

# 2. Third-party imports (if any)
# import requests

# 3. Local imports
# from .module import function

# 4. Constants
PASS_THRESHOLD: int = 80
GOOD_THRESHOLD: int = 60

# 5. Functions/Classes
def function_name():
    pass
```

## üß™ Testing Requirements

### All Changes Must Include Tests

### HIPAA Compliance Verification
In addition to functional tests, the following must be verified:
- **Data Anonymity:** All test data is demonstrably fictional and cannot be linked to real individuals.
- **Audit Trail:** New features that handle user data maintain a clear audit trail where appropriate.
- **Error Handling:** Systems fail securely, without leaking internal information or PHI in error messages:cite[1].
For new features:
```python
class TestNewFeature(unittest.TestCase):
    """Test suite for new feature"""
    
    def test_feature_basic_case(self):
        """Test basic functionality"""
        result = new_feature(input_data)
        self.assertEqual(result, expected_output)
    
    def test_feature_edge_case(self):
        """Test edge cases"""
        result = new_feature(edge_case_data)
        self.assertIsNotNone(result)
    
    def test_feature_error_handling(self):
        """Test error handling"""
        with self.assertRaises(ValueError):
            new_feature(invalid_data)
```

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
python test_hipaa_training_v2.py

# Run specific test class
python -m unittest test_hipaa_training_v2.py.TestClassName

# Run specific test method
python -m unittest test_hipaa_training_v2.py.TestClassName.test_method_name

# Run with verbose output
python test_hipaa_training_v2.py -v
```

### Test Coverage Requirements

- ‚úÖ All tests must pass before PR submission
- ‚úÖ New features require new tests
- ‚úÖ Bug fixes require regression tests
- ‚úÖ Edge cases must be tested
- ‚úÖ Error handling must be tested
